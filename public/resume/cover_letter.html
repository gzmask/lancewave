		<h3>Who is Ray?</h3>
		<p class="frame">
			My CS professors told me that I should call myself a "computer scientist" just becuase I know some facts such as "P != NP" without being able to proof it - otherwise we can call ourselves mathematicians. Deep down inside, I know that I am just a radical geek. I code. Everytime I encounter something repeative and slow, I can't stop thinking the word - "Ruby". I write Latex documents, logs, papers etc. My choise of the editor is <a href="../lisp.html">VIM</a>, since there is no better editor out there ;-}. I develope games. Knowing some linear algebras and matrix manipulations, I was able to code my own XNA first personal shooter in C# as my final university project. And some times I pawn boxes for the lanugh of children, legally(AKA, white hat hacking). I just passed my offensive security exam and certificated as an <a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/">OSCP</a>. That means I can perform penetration testing on networks and softwares effectively and fast(my 5 years Computer Science Degree definitely helps here). I know various common vulnerabilities down to the guts, such as off-by-ones, overflows, sym-links, injections, inclusions, traversal, privilege escalations etc., which makes me a good candidate as a SDET for your teams. I was a CG hobbyist too. I was into 3D max, Lightwave3D, Photoshop and After effect. I make beatiful interfaces(in my own terms), complicated 3D models, realistic textures and also animations and video compositions.

		<h3>How is Ray doing now?</h3>
		<p class="frame">
			I am currently working full time for <a href="http://www.uregina.ca/ctl/about/staff-directory">Centre for Academic Technologies</a> at University of Regina in Saskatchewan as a web developer. I install and take cares of our servers - web servers, git/svn repository servers, opencast course video capturing server and the like. I test and evaluate security measurements for extensions of the online Moodle base PHP course system. I script database migrations and html processings. Besides my full time job, I also work part time at <a href="http://www.melcher.ca">Melcher Media and Design</a>. I design and suggest network/server structures (mostly virtualization solutions), provide daily server maintenance, perform pentration testing, track down network attacks and bugs, writes unit testing to fine tune and stablize the web servers, train programmers and develope 3D game demos using XNA. I absolutely love my colleagues and the institution I curretnly work for - the working environment, the people and the pay is very satisfied. My part time job is very challenging yet I maintain good friendship with the partners in private.</p>
